            Sarah walked into the coffee shop, nervously adjusting her briefcase strap.<br><br>
            
            "Welcome to Moonlight CafÃ©," called out the barista cheerfully. "What can I get you today?"<br><br>
            
            "I'll have a large coffee, black," Sarah replied, scanning the room for her mysterious contact.<br><br>
            
            A tall man in a dark coat approached her table. "Sarah? I'm Agent Johnson. We need to talk."<br><br>
            
            "About what exactly?" Sarah asked, her voice trembling slightly.<br><br>
            
            "The files you discovered," Johnson said quietly. "They're more important than you realize."<br><br>
            
            Sarah felt her heart racing. "I don't know what you're talking about."<br><br>
            
            "Let's not play games," Johnson insisted. "Lives are at stake."<br><br>
            
            The barista interrupted their conversation. "Excuse me, but we're closing in five minutes."<br><br>
            
            Johnson stood up abruptly. "This conversation isn't over, Sarah. We'll be in touch."<br><br>
