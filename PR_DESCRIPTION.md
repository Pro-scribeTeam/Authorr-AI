# Enhanced AUTHORR AI Platform with Accurate Word Count & Reduced Glow

## 🚀 Major Platform Enhancements

This PR implements comprehensive improvements to the AUTHORR AI audiobook creation platform, addressing critical functionality and visual design updates.

### ✨ Key Features Implemented

#### 🎯 **Story Generation Accuracy Fix**
- **CRITICAL FIX**: Resolved word count accuracy issue where '500 words per chapter' only generated 159 total words
- Implemented **individual chapter generation** approach using separate OpenAI API calls per chapter
- Enhanced word count verification and reporting with actual vs target statistics
- Added proper rate limiting and error handling between chapter generations

#### 🎨 **Visual Design Improvements**
- **Reduced glow effects** on AUTHORR AI header text for better readability (as requested)
- Updated CSS variables for more subtle glow effects throughout the platform
- Maintained brand consistency with cyan (#78e3fe) color scheme and silver accents

#### 🔧 **Technical Enhancements**
- Fixed story generation API response structure to return actual generated content
- Enhanced usage statistics showing per-chapter word count accuracy
- Improved OpenAI API integration with proper error handling and demo mode fallbacks
- Updated form field visibility and styling for both light and dark modes

### 🐛 **Bug Fixes**

1. **Word Count Accuracy**: Fixed the core issue where chapter word count requirements weren't being met
2. **API Response Structure**: Corrected story generation endpoint to return `fullStory` instead of completion metadata
3. **Demo Mode Handling**: Improved validation to prevent demo messages with working API keys
4. **Form Field Visibility**: Fixed white-on-white text issues in light mode

### 📊 **Technical Implementation**

#### Story Generation Algorithm:
```javascript
// Enhanced approach: Generate each chapter individually for better word count accuracy
for (let i = 0; i < chapters.length; i++) {
  const chapter = chapters[i]
  console.log(`Generating Chapter ${chapter.id}: ${chapter.title} (Target: ${wordsPerChapter} words)`)
  
  const chapterCompletion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages: [{
      role: "system",
      content: `You are a professional ${genre} writer. Write exactly ONE chapter with EXACTLY ${wordsPerChapter} words.`
    }],
    max_tokens: estimatedTokensPerChapter,
    temperature: 0.7
  })
  
  // Verify word count and accumulate
  const chapterWords = chapterContent.trim().split(/\s+/).filter(word => word.length > 0).length
  console.log(`Chapter ${chapter.id} generated: ${chapterWords} words (target: ${wordsPerChapter})`)
}
```

#### CSS Glow Reduction:
```css
/* Reduced from intense glow to subtle effect */
--brand-cyan-glow: 0 0 8px rgba(120, 227, 254, 0.4), 0 0 16px rgba(120, 227, 254, 0.2);
--brand-silver-glow: 0 0 5px rgba(192, 192, 192, 0.6), 0 0 10px rgba(192, 192, 192, 0.3);
```
